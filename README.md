Analyze_early_coagulated_thrombus.m
Grouping the coagulation THz traces into early-coagulated blood and thrombus groups.


cac_absorption.m	
Customized function to calculate the absorption constants using traces from THz TDS measurement.


Blind_of_cac_function
Calculate the absorption constants of all groups of bloods from the THz TDS measurement.


Plot_export_coagulation_ttest_pvalue.m
Perform two-tailed two-sample t-test of the absorption constants between different blood groups and plot the results with boxplots in individual frequencies. Plotting histograms for the test of normality. 


Correlation_PLT.m, Correlation_PLT_heparin.m, and Correlation_RBC.m 	
Conduct Pearson correlation analysis between the examined hematological variables and the absorption coefficients. Plot the results with Origin (OriginLab).
